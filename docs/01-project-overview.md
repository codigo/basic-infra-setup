# Understanding the Mau App Infrastructure Project: Part 1 - Overview

Welcome to this comprehensive guide on the Mau App Infrastructure project! This series of blog posts will walk you through the intricacies of setting up a modern, scalable, and secure infrastructure for web applications. Whether you're a novice developer or have some experience under your belt, this guide will help you understand the various components and technologies used in this project.

## What is the Mau App Infrastructure?

The Mau App Infrastructure is a robust setup designed to host a portfolio and blog application. It leverages various cloud services and technologies to create a scalable, secure, and easily maintainable infrastructure. Here's a high-level overview of what's included:

1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Using Pulumi with TypeScript to define and manage cloud resources.
2. **Cloud Providers**: Utilizing AWS for storage and Hetzner Cloud for compute resources.
3. **Containerization**: Employing Docker and Docker Swarm for application deployment and management.
4. **Reverse Proxy and SSL**: Implementing Caddy as a reverse proxy with automatic HTTPS.
5. **Database and Search**: Integrating PocketBase for database management and Typesense for search functionality.
6. **Monitoring and Logging**: Using Dozzle for log management.
7. **CI/CD**: Implementing GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.
8. **Security**: Leveraging Cloudflare for DDoS protection and secure access.

## Why This Matters

Understanding how to set up and manage such an infrastructure is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Scalability**: This setup can easily handle growing traffic and data needs.
2. **Security**: Multiple layers of security are implemented to protect your application and data.
3. **Maintainability**: Using IaC and containerization makes it easier to manage and update your infrastructure.
4. **Cost-Effectiveness**: By leveraging the right tools and services, you can optimize costs while maintaining performance.

## What's Coming Up

In the following posts, we'll dive deep into each component of this infrastructure. We'll explore:

- Setting up Pulumi for infrastructure management
- Configuring cloud providers (AWS and Hetzner)
- Implementing Docker and Docker Swarm
- Setting up Caddy as a reverse proxy
- Integrating PocketBase and Typesense
- Configuring Cloudflare for security and performance
- Implementing CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- And much more!

Stay tuned for the next part, where we'll start by setting up Pulumi and exploring how it helps us manage our infrastructure as code.
